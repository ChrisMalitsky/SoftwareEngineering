Project: ASRC Machine Learning

Version 3.0

Our System machine learns, using Bagged Trees, on sponsor given data and then predicts the outcome of whether the decay coefficients are "Fine", "On the Way", or "In Danger"

Input: Data (.txt)

Output: # of correct Compressor decay predictions, # of correct Turbine decay predictions, % Compressor correct, % Turbine correct, Pie charts to display these values, Confusion Matrices
